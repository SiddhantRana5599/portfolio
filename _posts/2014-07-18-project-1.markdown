description: Overview: The Spotify Dashboard project aims to create a dynamic and interactive user interface for displaying my personalized Spotify data for the last 6 years(2019-2025). The dashboard pulls information from my Spotify data(JSON files) to showcase real-time user statistics such as top tracks, favorite artists, listening history, song end reason and in which part of the day I listened the most. The interface is designed to provide a user-friendly experience while offering in-depth insights into my music preferences and activity.

Overall Listening:

Significant Usage: I have listened to a substantial amount of music, with 23.51K total songs played and 48.38K total minutes (approximately 806 hours).

Diverse Catalog: I have explored a wide range of music, with 989 unique artists, 2134 unique songs, and 1936 unique albums. This suggests a broad taste in music.
Key Insights:

Listening Trends Over Time:

Peak in 2022: The "Songs per Year" graph shows a clear peak in listening activity in 2022. This could be due to various factors like more free time, specific events, or simply a period of heightened music discovery.

Decline After Peak: There's a noticeable decline in listening after 2022, though there's a slight uptick towards 2024.
Top Content:

Top Songs: "Hold On" is the most played song with 154 plays, followed by "Can't Let You Go" (122 plays). This highlights my favorite tracks.

Top Artists: Pritam is the most listened-to artist by a significant margin (756 plays), followed by Amit Trivedi (641 plays) and Justin Bieber (533 plays). This suggests a strong preference for these artists.

Listening Behavior:

Song End Reasons:

"Trackdone" (song finished playing) is the most common reason for a song ending (40.94%), which is normal.

"Fwdbtn" (forward button) accounts for a substantial portion (21.77%), "Endplay" (I played another song) makes up 20.68%. and "Backbtn" (backward button) accounts for (6.91%)and indicating that I frequently skips songs. This could mean I may be exploring new music, not enjoying certain parts of songs, or using playlists with some unwanted tracks.

Parts of Day:
"Afternoon" is the most popular time for listening (37.20%), followed by "Morning" (26.08%). This suggests that I listens to music during the day, likely during work, study, or commuting.

Platform Usage:

Dominant Platform: The dashboard indicates usage across multiple platforms (Android, Webplayer, Windows) with Android being the dominant platform, followed by Windows and webplayer.
Key Questions and Further Analysis:

Reasons for 2022 Peak and Subsequent Decline: Exploring external factors or changes in the my life during these periods could provide valuable insights.

Reasons for Skipping Songs: Investigating the types of songs skipped or the context in which I skipped could reveal more about my taste and listening habits

Platform Preference: Using Android as the primary platform we could inform platform-specific optimizations or recommendations.

Diverse Catalog: I have explored a wide range of music, with 989 unique artists, 2134 unique songs, and 1936 unique albums. This suggests a broad taste in music.
